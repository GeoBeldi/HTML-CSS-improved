## Name

Improvements on HTML structure and CSS code

# Description

The title of the website was just named "website". I chose a concise name for this website and I entitled it: "Market and optimize in one place".
I have applied the semantic elements in HTML. I replaced the correspondent div with nav tag for SEO purposes. The same I did for the rest of div tags, I have replaced the div tags with the correspodent semantic elements such as: nav tag for navigation links, section for the image banner, main for content, aside for benefits and lastly the footer tag.
The first hyperlink named "search engine optimization" was not working, meaning the first anchor link was not pointing anywhere on the page when clicking on it. So to make it functional I have added an id for the first article element and I have connected it with the anchor element in nav.
For each image in HTML I have added an 'alt' description in order to improve the SEO for the webpage.
I ensured that I have only one h1 element and I have kept the h2 for the main content within the article tags, for the aside element I have kept h3 and h6 for the footer.
In CSS I have combined the same classes which have the same attributes and values in order to reduce the line codes.
